# Misc Docs
Just some misc. documents with my assorted thoughts.

1. <b>Truth About Electron Behavior</b> - document explaining how mistakes made in double-slit experiment means wave-particle duality does not exist. Please note: this document is based on my thinking how ridiculous the wave-particle sounded, and after seeing a video of Dr Brian Greene using a bowling ball to demonstrate how electrons had moved in the double slit experiment and I had to call BS, at no point in time should we expected electrons to moving in any fashion ressembling how any normal object would move. This document is my thoughts and reseach combined and rewritten by llama 3
2. <b>Thoughts about Light</b> - My thoughts about what light is (it's atomic energy wave).


more to come, possible some thoughts on gravity, magnetism and the strong nuclear force.
