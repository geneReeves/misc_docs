# Misc Docs
Just some misc. documents with my assorted thoughts.

1. <b>Truth About Electron Behavior</b> - document explaining mistakes made in double-slit experiment means wave-particle duality does not exists.


more to come, maybe something about light being an atomic energy wave, and possible some thoughts on gravity, magnetism and the strong nuclear force.
