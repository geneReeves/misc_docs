# Misc Docs
Just some misc. documents with my assorted thoughts.

1. <b>Truth About Electron Behavior</b> - document explaining how mistakes made in double-slit experiment means wave-particle duality does not exist.
2. <b>Thoughts about Light</b> - My thoughts about what light is (it's atomic energy wave).


more to come, possible some thoughts on gravity, magnetism and the strong nuclear force.
