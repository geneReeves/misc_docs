# Light represent an atomic energy wave

back in school I was taught that atom with a higher level than ambient at the current temperature will radiate atomic energy and if lower then it will absorb atomic enegery until equal lybrym is reach.
I was also taught that if we impart energy into the atom by appyinmg heat to it. And if we apply heat to an atom the orbital rate of it's electrons will increase, thus meaning the orbital rate of an atoms electrons represents the level of atomic energy contained in the atom at that moment.
We can observe this behavior by using a torch to apply heat to a steel bar, as we heat the steel, the orbital rate of one or more of the atom in the stell will reach a rate corresponding to the lower end of the IR band of the atomic energy spectrum, we would feel the steel radiating heat, as we continue to apply heat, the orbital rate will continue to increase untill it begins to reach the upper end of the IR band, which overlapse the lower end of the light spectrum, at which point we begin to see the steel glowing, this is the atoms in the steel radiating there atomic energy at a wavelengthj corrisponding to the orbital rate of there electrons, thus proving light is just what we detect as the atomic energy being radiated at a wavelength in our visual spectrum.
